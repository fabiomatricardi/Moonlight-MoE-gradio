#### 🌔 MoonShot AI
> [Moonlight 16B A3B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai) is a 16B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model developed by Moonshot AI. It is optimized for instruction-following tasks with 3B activated parameters per inference. The model advances the Pareto frontier in performance per FLOP across English, coding, math, and Chinese benchmarks.<br>
> It outperforms comparable models like Llama3-3B and Deepseek-v2-Lite while maintaining efficient deployment capabilities through Hugging Face integration and compatibility with popular inference engines like vLLM12.
